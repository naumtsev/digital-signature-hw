## RSA Algorithm Implementation

### Overview
This project implements the RSA algorithm within the framework of Distributed Ledger Technology. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm for secure data transmission.

### Files
pows - file handles operations involving powering numbers, a crucial aspect of RSA algorithm

primes - file is responsible for generating random prime numbers based on bit size, a fundamental requirement in RSA algorithm

main - file encapsulates the implementation of the RSA Algorithm itself
